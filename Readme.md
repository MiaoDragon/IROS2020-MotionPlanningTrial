# Running ROS and Gazebo on an Ubuntu Desktop via Docker

This Dockerfile will install ROS Melodic with Gazebo 9 on Ubuntu 18.04, and give you a VNC interface to work within that environment. The container is tested and working on Windows 10 and Mac OS X. If you need ROS Kinetic with Turtlebot simulations, be sure to check out [the `kinetic` branch](https://github.com/jbnunn/ROSGazeboDesktop/tree/kinetic).

To install:

    git clone https://github.com/jbnunn/ROSGazeboDesktop
    cd ROSGazeboDesktop
    docker build -t ros-gazebo-desktop .

## Start and Connect to The Container

Work you do in the container's `~/data` directory will be saved to your local `data` directory. On your host, create a `data` directory:

    mkdir data

Now when launching the container, we'll use the `-v` flag to mount `data` inside the container at `/home/ubuntu/data`.

### Windows

    docker run -it --rm --name=ros_gazebo_desktop -m=4g -p 6080:80 -p 5900:5900 -v %cd%/data:/home/ubuntu/data -e RESOLUTION=1920x1080 -e USER=ubuntu -e PASSWORD=ubuntu ros-gazebo-desktop

### OS X / Linux:

    docker run -it --rm --name=ros_gazebo_desktop -m=4g -p 6080:80 -p 5900:5900 -v "$PWD/data:/home/ubuntu/data" -v "$PWD/src:/home/ubuntu/catkin_ws/src" -e "RESOLUTION=1280x800" -e "USER=ubuntu" -e PASSWORD=ubuntu ros-gazebo-desktop

We also expose port 5900 so you can connect with a VNC client, and/or port 6080 so you can connect via your browser using NoVNC. You can change the `RESOLUTION` to match screen dimensions appropriate for your display, and the `USER` environment variable to change the user that logs into the desktop. In most cases, you'll want to leave this as the `ubuntu` user (password `ubuntu`).

Once the `docker run` command finishes running, connect to the container using a VNC client or via http://locahost:6080/. From the Ubuntu desktop, open a terminal, and try:

    roslaunch gazebo_ros empty_world.launch

This will launch the Gazebo virtual world simulator with a default, empty world. Let's spawn the ["Create" robot from iRobot](https://www.irobot.com/about-irobot/stem/create-2), which is based off the Roomba platform. Open a new terminal, then:

    rosrun gazebo_ros spawn_model -file ~/.gazebo/models/create/model-1_4.sdf -sdf -model Create

You should see `Spawn status: SpawnModel: Successfully spawned entity`. Switch views back to Gazebo and you'll find the Create robot in your virtual world. It should look similar to the following.

![Gazebo Environment with Create Robot](./gazebo-create.png)

There are other worlds you can launch:

    roslaunch gazebo_ros willowgarage_world.launch
    roslaunch gazebo_ros mud_world.launch
    roslaunch gazebo_ros shapes_world.launch
    roslaunch gazebo_ros rubble_world.launch

Take a look at the syntax at [http://gazebosim.org/tutorials?tut=ros_roslaunch](http://gazebosim.org/tutorials?tut=ros_roslaunch) for details on other launch options.

### Make the robot move

In a new terminal, list the currently available ROS topics:

    $ rostopic list

    /clock
    /gazebo/link_states
    /gazebo/model_states
    /gazebo/parameter_descriptions
    /gazebo/parameter_updates
    /gazebo/set_link_state
    /gazebo/set_model_state
    /rosout

We can manipulate the Create robot by sending a message to `model_state`. Publish a message to that topic:

    rostopic pub /gazebo/set_model_state gazebo_msgs/ModelState '{model_name: Create, pose: { position: { x: 0, y: 0, z: 0 }, orientation: {x: 0, y: 0, z: 0} }, twist: { linear: { x: 1, y: 0, z: 0 }, angular: { x: 0, y: 0, z: 0}  }, reference_frame: world }'

This command:

1) Publishes a topic to the set_model_state topic of type `gazebo_msgs/ModelState`
2) Contains the model name we specifed when we spawned the robot, `Create`
3) Specifies an initial "pose" *x, y, z* position of `(0, 0, 0)`, and an initial orientation of `(0, 0, 0)`
4) Specifies a "twist" component that tells it to move along the *x* axis
5) Tells the topic that all of this happens in our `world` reference frame

## Other Robot Models and Considerations

* Many OSRF robot and models can be downloaded to your Docker container, and can be found at [https://bitbucket.org/osrf/gazebo_models/src/default/](https://bitbucket.org/osrf/gazebo_models/src/default/).

         hg clone https://bitbucket.org/osrf/gazebo_models ~/.gazebo/models

* If you continue your experiments with the Create model, look at [https://gist.github.com/eddiem3/4f257b769d53c492b7ea0dc482cd7caa](https://gist.github.com/eddiem3/4f257b769d53c492b7ea0dc482cd7caa) or [http://guitarpenguin.is-programmer.com/posts/58100.html](http://guitarpenguin.is-programmer.com/posts/58100.html) for info on adding a differential-drive plugin.

## Wrap

You now have a working robotic simulation environment. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is available to you under the "Programming" menu item if you need a nice IDE. Don't forget that your work will not be saved unless you are working from the `/home/ubuntu/data` folder (or other folder(s) you mount with the `-v` flag.)

## Troubleshooting

### Gazebo is slow or processes hang

This is likely a memory issue. Launch your container with more RAM, 4GB for example, with the `-m=4g` flag. Your default Docker installation might be set to something lower, see [here to change those settings](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44533319/how-to-assign-more-memory-to-docker-container).
